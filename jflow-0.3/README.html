    <h1>jflow - Java-based Netflow Processing</h1>

    <p>Copyright (C) 2002-2007 <a href="mailto:oliver@net-track.ch">Oliver Hitz</a></p>

    <p>
      jflow is a set of Java classes for collecting and analyzing
      NetFlow data. NetFlow is a Cisco invention for monitoring
      traffic flows inside a network.
    </p>

    <p>
      jflow supports version 5 and 6 NetFlow packets. It is
      multithreaded and designed primarily to do real-time traffic
      accounting and analysis. All flows entering the Collector are
      processed in two steps:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Filtering: The goal of this stage is to reduce the number of
	flows. If a flow matches one of the freely pluggable filters,
	this flow will be ignored and not taken to the accounting
	step.
      </li>
      <li>
	Accounting: All flows not matching one of the filters are run
	through the accounting modules where the actual traffic
	accounting or analysis takes place.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Please note that jflow does not offer a lot of fancy features,
      it probably never will. It was designed as a building block for
      traffic accounting, network monitoring and anomaly detection.
    </p>

    <h2>Performance</h2>

    <p>
      jflow is currently being used for real-time traffic accounting
      in networks carrying up to 100 Mbps of data. Performance has
      never been an issue so far. Of course, it depends on what you
      want to do with the data.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the jflow Classes</h2>

    <p>
      Using the jflow classes is relatively simple:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Define your filtering and accounting modules by implementing
	the interface <tt>nettrack.net.netflow.Filter</tt> and
	<tt>nettrack.net.netflow.Accountant</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
	Create an instance of <tt>nettrack.net.netflow.Collector</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>
	Attach to the collector either a <tt>V5FlowHandler</tt> or a
	<tt>V6FlowHandler</tt>, depending on the NetFlow version you
	will be using.
      </li>
      <li>
	Attach to this handler your filtering and accounting modules.
      </li>
      <li>
	Start the collector using the <tt>start</tt> method. Note that
	the collector is multithreaded. Calling <tt>start</tt> will
	start collecting in the background, the call will return
	immediately.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples</h2>

    <p>
      jflow is not a complete software tool for using NetFlow data,
      but rather a set of classes that can help you to write such
      tools. The <tt>examples/</tt> directory contains examples that
      explain how to use the classes.
    </p>

    <h3>print: Print Flows</h3>

    <p>
      <tt>V5Printer</tt> collects version 5 NetFlow data and prints it
      to the console. It takes the source address of the NetFlow probe
      as argument:
    </p>

    <pre>
$ java -cp print.jar:../../lib/jflow.jar V5Print [source]
</pre>

    <h3>ipaccount: Per IP Address Accounting</h3>

    <p>
      <tt>V5IpAccount</tt> shows how per-ip address accounting can be
      done using the jflow classes. It takes as arguments the ip
      address of the NetFlow probe, and a subnet in
      <em>network/mask</em> format and does traffic accounting for all
      the ip addresses in the selected network. Every five seconds, it
      prints the results:
    </p>

    <pre>
$ java -cp ipaccount.jar:../../lib/jflow.jar V5IpAccount [source] [network/mask]
</pre>

    <h3>recorder: NetFlow Record and Replay</h3>

    <p>
      <tt>V5Record</tt> collects version 5 NetFlow data and dumps it
      into a file:
    </p>

    <pre>
$ java -cp recorder.jar:../../lib/jflow.jar V5Record flows.dump
</pre>

    <p>
      Using <tt>V5Replay</tt>, this data can now be sent to a
      host. Just specify the host and port, as well as the timing in
      milliseconds. To send the data at 100 ms intervals, launch
      <tt>V5Replay</tt> as follows:
    </p>

    <pre>
$ java -cp recorder.jar:../../lib/jflow.jar V5Replay flows.dump [host] [port] 100
</pre>
